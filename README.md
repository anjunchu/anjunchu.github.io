# My Personal Website

I construct my personal website based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), using Scriptor theme from [JustGoodThemes](https://github.com/JustGoodThemes/Scriptor-Jekyll-Theme).

## Deployment

### Local Installation

To set up Jekyll on local machine please follow the official documentation that can be found here -> https://jekyllrb.com/docs/.

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run `bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.

### Manual Deployment

Jekyll generates your static site to the **_site** directory by default. You can transfer the contents of this directory to almost any hosting provider to get your site live.

### Github Pages

In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages supports Jekyll.

## Licenses

All files and directories are licensed under the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) unless explicitly stated.
